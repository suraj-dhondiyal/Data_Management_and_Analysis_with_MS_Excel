# 🚴‍♂️ Excel Data Analysis Project - Customer Insights & Recommendations

## 👋 Introduction

Hi! This project is part of my data analysis learning journey using Microsoft Excel. In this analysis, I worked with customer, transaction, and product data for a fictional bike-selling company. The goal was to generate meaningful insights and provide actionable business recommendations based on the data.

The entire analysis was done in Excel, using tools like pivot tables, charts, conditional formatting, and basic formulas.
