# Excel Data Analysis Project â€“ Customer Insights and Recommendations

## Introduction

This project represents a data analysis case study conducted using Microsoft Excel. The dataset includes customer, transaction, and product information from a fictional bike-selling company. The objective was to extract key insights and provide strategic business recommendations based on patterns observed in customer behavior and sales performance.

All analysis was performed in Excel using tools such as pivot tables, charts, conditional formatting, and standard functions for data manipulation and visualization.

## Key Insights

### Customer Segmentation
- **Wealth Segments**: Customers classified under the "High Wealth" segment tend to make purchases more frequently and at higher values. "Mass Customers" display moderate spending patterns.
- **Gender Trends**: Female customers are more active in bike-related purchases than their male counterparts.
- **Industry Trends**: A significant portion of high-value customers come from job sectors like IT, Finance, and Management.

### Transaction and Sales Patterns
- **Seasonality**: Sales volumes peak during the mid-year months (June to August), potentially due to promotional activities or seasonal demand.
- **Product Performance**: Medium-class bikes and premium brands, such as Brand X, account for the highest sales revenue.
- **Customer Behavior**: High-value purchasing behavior is mainly associated with the "High Wealth" customer segment.

### New Customer Insights
- **Geographic Distribution**: New customers are predominantly located in urban regions such as New South Wales and Queensland.
- **Demographics**: These customers often come from areas with higher property values, aligning with higher income brackets.
- **Revenue Opportunity**: New customers show interest in high-value items, suggesting strong potential for revenue growth if appropriately targeted.

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Customers from the "High Wealth" segment and those with longer engagement periods show significantly higher CLV.
- Professionals in IT and Finance exhibit higher CLVs due to consistent and frequent purchases.

## Recommendations

### Marketing Strategy
- **High-Value Customer Targeting**: Implement exclusive loyalty programs and personalized marketing campaigns for high-wealth customers.
- **Gender-Based Campaigns**: Develop campaigns that highlight women-specific products and preferences, given the higher engagement of female buyers.
- **Industry-Specific Offers**: Launch targeted initiatives focused on professionals in high-value sectors such as IT and Finance.

### Business Expansion
- **Urban Market Focus**: Increase marketing efforts in cities like New South Wales and Queensland, where new customer density is highest.
- **Regional Growth Opportunities**: Expand product availability and promotional activities to suburban and high-value regional areas.
- **Geo-Targeted Advertising**: Use geographic segmentation to deploy localized advertisements and promotions.

### Product Strategy
- **Enhance Premium Offerings**: Expand product lines in the mid-to-high performance categories to meet demand.
- **Capitalize on Seasonal Trends**: Plan major sales and promotional campaigns during mid-year months to take advantage of seasonal buying behavior.
- **Brand Development**: Strengthen the presence of high-performing brands through increased promotion and possible partnerships.
